                <p>Noah is an Atlanta native, and has lived in the city – or its suburbs – almost his entire life.
                    After
                    graduating from Blessed Trinity High School in Roswell, Noah attended the University of Georgia in
                    Athens. Noah graduated
                    Magna Cum Laude with a dual major in Finance and International Business.</p>

                <p>After graduation, Noah moved to Raleigh, North Carolina to work as an analyst for PNC Bank. He
                    worked
                    in the Treasury Management group within Corporate and Institutional Banking, where he focused on
                    delivering financial technology products to businesses in order to optimize operational
                    efficiencies.</p>

                <p>Noah currently works as an Associate Relationship Manager within Commercial Banking in Midtown,
                    Atlanta. As an Associate, Noah is tasked with being an advisor to the businesses he works with. He
                    provides industry trends and insights, access to capital, and a variety of products spanning from
                    Treasury Management to Capital Markets. Noah’s goal is to ensure the businesses he works with have
                    all
                    the tools and resources they need to succeed.</p>

                <p>When he’s not at work, Noah is usually trying a new restaurant, playing golf, watching UGA football,
                    or
                    working on his website (GeorgiaonmyDime.com). Noah is passionate about finance and technology,
                    and is currently attending the Georgia Institute of Technology Coding Bootcamp with the goal of
                    creating a
                    career that encompasses both passions.</p>
